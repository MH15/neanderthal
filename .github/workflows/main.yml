# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. 
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the master branch
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:

    steps:
      # Install Dependencies
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2.1.4
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install 
      # Tests
      - name: Run Tests
        run: npm run test
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
#   build:
#     # The type of runner that the job will run on
#     runs-on: ubuntu-latest

#     # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
#     steps:
#       # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
#       - uses: actions/checkout@v2

#       # Runs a single command using the runners shell
#       - name: Run a one-line script
#         run: echo Hello, world!

#       # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
#       - name: Run a multi-line script
#         run: |
#           echo Add other actions to build,
#           echo test, and deploy your project.
